  <p>Welcome to <b>Snail's shell</b>! Your friendly neighborhood Interaction Designer.</p>
  <p>Want to see what exactly I do?<p><br>
  <a href="https://www.behance.net/snehalsmalcb5b"><button>Behance profile:</button></a><br>
  <br><br>
  <p> Okay here's some more, my skills include:</p>
  Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Autodesk Sketchbook, Procreate, yada yada yada </p>
  More importantly though, I draw, paint and sing. 
  I can't help but jig a move when a known song plays in the supermarket. 
  I'm a great third wheel, always there to support your relationships and comfort you through your breakups.
  If it's any help, I give warm hugs and make a mean Guacamole :)
  So you've made it to the end of the page, you're cute. </p>
